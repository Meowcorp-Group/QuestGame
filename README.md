## License
We are discussing a license based on our planned distribution method. We will update this when we have decided.

For now, All Rights Reserved. But there's nothing even here yet, so don't worry about it.

<details>
<summary>Elaborate?</summary>

We really want to release this under GPL, but some platforms, such as Steam, [have restrictions on GPL software](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading/distributing_opensource). We are looking into ways to get around this, but we may have to release under a different license.

Ideas:
- Release the game under GPL, but have a separate license for the Steam release
- LGPL (this may also have restrictions on Steam)
- MIT/Expat (i hate this license)
- MPL
- Apache
- BSD

> [!NOTE]
> This game may not even be released on Steam, since we (I) cannot afford to start an LLC (up to $4000 USD!), and releasing as an individual (Sole Proprietorship) has some legal risks.

> this legal stuff is making me go insane.
> come back in 2 days where we'll probably have this out as L/GPL*
